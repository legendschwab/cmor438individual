Up until now data has been defined in terms of feature vectors in $R^n$. However, many data sets are better described by a relational structure. *Graph Theory* refers to using graph-like structures to better understand the relationship between data points.

Formally, a graph is defined as a tuple of 2 sets, vertices $V$ and edges $E$. Edges connect the vertices either with direction in directed graphs or in both directions in undirected graphs.

There are many problems we can explore with graph theory. In this folder, we will explore label propagation and maximum clique.
