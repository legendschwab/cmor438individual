# CMOR 438 Data Science and Machine Learning Individual Repository

In this repository, we will cover major data science/machine learning algorithms and implement them on data sets. 

I'm a huge roller coaster enthusiast so I wanteed to apply these learning models to better understand roller coasters. So the main data I used is a roller coaster data set taken from Kaggle. It contains over a thousand rows for roller coasters around the world, including key metrics like height, speed, length, G-force, and more.

The second data set that I used is on board games. Board games is one of my favorite hobbies. This data is also from Kaggle and scrapes data on the top 1000 board games from BoardGameGeek.com.
