# CMOR 438 Data Science and Machine Learning Individual Repository

In this repository, we will cover major data science/machine learning algorithms and implement them on data sets. 

I'm a huge roller coaster enthusiast so I wanted to apply these machine learning models to better understand roller coasters. So the main data I used is a roller coaster data set taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/rollercoaster-database). It contains over a thousand rows for roller coasters around the world, including key metrics like height, speed, length, G-force, and more. Data is scraped from Wikipedia. The second data set that I used is on board games. Board games is one of my favorite hobbies. This data is also from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/board-games/data) and scrapes data on over 90,000 board games from BoardGameGeek.com. The final data set I used was data on Facebook friend connections, which I will use for the Graph Theory section of my repository. This again is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wolfram77/graphs-social/data). 

For all the following notebooks, you can reproduce results by downloading the included data sets and running the cells from top to bottom.
