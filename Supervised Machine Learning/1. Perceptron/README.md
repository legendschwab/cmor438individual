The **perceptron** is the most fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm. Based on neural perceptrons in the human body, this algorithm takes in a set of inputs as a signal, outputs an intermediate value through a weighted linear combination, and then outputs a final value based on some activation function.

The training of a perceptron model determines the set of weights that will minimize the cost function. First, we start with a random initial guess for our weights $$w$$ as well as our bias $$b$$ (denoted as $$w_0$$ in the figure). Using this, we calculate the predicted value $$\hat{y}_i$$ for each $$x_i$$.

Then, we use an iterative method to improve our weights based on the error between the predicted and actual values of $$y_i$$. 

$$
 w \gets w - \frac{1}{2} (\hat{y}_i - y_i) x_i
$$

$$
 b \gets b - \frac{1}{2} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)
$$

We have created a Perceptron Machine Learning package that can be applied to solve linear regression, logistic regression, and neural network problems.
