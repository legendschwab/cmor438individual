**Logistic Regression** is a regression model that builds upon linear regression by outputting a probability value between 0 and 1. Similar to linear regression, it takes in a set of inputs and applies a linear combination of them. However, this output value is then transformed into a probability value using an exponential function.

Logistic regression can be used for binary classification tasks where the predicted probability represents the probability that an object belongs in one classification over the other.
