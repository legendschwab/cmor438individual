**Neural Networks** is a multi-layer representation of the perceptron model.

Each node takes in a set of inputs and outputs a value based on an activation function similar to the perceptron model. However, there are hidden intermediate layers. Each layer has its own set of weights and bias values. 

We use a process called **back propagation** to solve for the optimal weights.
