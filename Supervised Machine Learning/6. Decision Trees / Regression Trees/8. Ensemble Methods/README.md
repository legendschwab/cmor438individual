Decision trees are machine learning algorithsm that can help with both classificaiton and regression.

For classifiation,  we create a tree that hsa either root nodes or leaf nodes. At root nodes, we separate our data into 2 groups based on a condition. If all of our data at a node is in the same category, we have reached a leaf node
