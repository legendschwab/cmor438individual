Supervised Machine Learning is a class of machine learning where we work with labelled data to predict outcomes and discern relationships. 

Within supervised machine learning, there are two types: regression and classification. Regression focuses on predicting an output value given inputs. These values usually take on a continuous range. However, classification focuses on assigning categorical values given inputs. In supervised machine learning algorithms, our data points are pre-labelled with these categories.

Examples Include: 
1. Perceptron
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Neural Networks
5. K-Nearest Neighbors
6. Decision Trees / Regression Trees
7. Random Forests
8. Ensemble Methods Such As Boosting
